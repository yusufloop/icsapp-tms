# Product Context: ICS Boltz TMS App

## 1. Problem Space

This Transportation Management System (TMS) application aims to solve the challenges associated with managing transportation and shipment requests within the ICS Boltz ecosystem. It provides a centralized mobile platform for users to create, track, and manage shipment requests efficiently, replacing manual processes and paper-based workflows with an automated, digital solution.

**Key Problems Addressed:**
- Manual transportation request processing leading to delays and errors
- Lack of real-time shipment tracking and status visibility
- Inefficient approval workflows across different organizational levels
- Poor communication between requesters, approvers, and administrators
- Difficulty in managing user permissions and access control
- Limited visibility into request history and audit trails

## 2. User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity:** The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to complete their transportation requests with minimal friction.
- **Clarity:** Information should be presented clearly and concisely, ensuring that users can understand the status of their shipment requests and related data at a glance.
- **Reliability:** The app must be stable and performant, providing a consistent and dependable experience for critical transportation operations.
- **Role-Based Efficiency:** Each user role should have a tailored experience that shows only relevant features and actions.
- **Premium Feel:** Following the "Effortless Premium" design philosophy inspired by Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.

## 3. How It Works

The application guides users through a seamless authentication process to access their role-based dashboard. Based on their role (REQUESTER, HEAD_OF_DEPARTMENT, GENERAL_MANAGER, or ADMIN), users see different navigation tabs and features:

**For Requesters:**
- Dashboard with overview and quick stats
- My Requests section to view and manage submitted requests

**For Administrators:**

The user interface leverages a comprehensive design system with premium components, consistent spacing, and purposeful animations to create a professional, Apple-inspired experience.
