# Active Context: ICS Boltz TMS App

## 1. Current Work Focus

**PROJECT TRANSITION: IMS to TMS**
The project has been successfully transitioned from an Inventory Management System (IMS) to a Transportation Management System (TMS). The core architecture and components remain the same, but the context and purpose have been updated to focus on transportation and shipment request management.

**FULLY IMPLEMENTED: Comprehensive Role-Based Transportation Management System**
The TMS application is feature-complete with a sophisticated role-based access control system that manages transportation/shipment requests through different organizational levels.

**LATEST IMPLEMENTATION: API-Based Autofill Function for New Booking - COMPLETED**
Successfully replaced hardcoded JSON autofill with API-based autofill function in both web and mobile versions of the new booking page. The implementation fetches real-time data from the provided ngrok endpoint and populates all form fields with proper error handling and user feedback.

**PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION: Edit Booking System with Dropdown Integration - COMPLETED**
Successfully implemented a comprehensive edit booking system with both web and mobile versions, including proper integration with existing booking cards and dropdown tables. The system provides full editing capabilities for existing bookings with pre-populated data and real-time cost calculation.

**PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION: Web Versions of New Booking Flow Steps 2 & 3 - COMPLETED**
Successfully created the web versions of Steps 2 and 3 of the 3-step new booking flow, completing the full web implementation of the booking process. Both steps follow the same web-optimized patterns as Step 1 with constrained width layout, proper scrolling, and reliable navigation.

**PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION: Web Version of New Booking Flow Step 1 - COMPLETED**
Successfully created the web version of Step 1 of the 3-step new booking flow with web-optimized layout and functionality. The implementation includes constrained width layout, proper scrolling, and reliable navigation specifically designed for web usage.

**PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION: User Management System - COMPLETED**
Successfully implemented a comprehensive user management system with both creation and editing capabilities. The system includes new user creation, user editing with status management, and multiple access points through the UI.

**PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION: 3-Step New Booking Flow - COMPLETED**
Successfully implemented a complete modern 3-step booking flow to replace the old new request system. All three steps are now fully implemented and connected, providing users with a comprehensive and intuitive way to create transportation bookings from start to finish.
